v2.0.0 (unreleased)
===================

* **Breaking:** the ``translate_messages`` management command has been renamed to
  ``autotranslate``.
* Messages whose source string changed (marked fuzzy by ``makemessages``) are now
  retranslated, and fuzzy entries awaiting review are no longer overwritten.
  ``--set-fuzzy`` marks the new machine translations for review.
* Added an optional progress bar (``--progress/--no-progress``), install the
  ``progress`` extra to use it.
* ``AUTOTRANSLATE_SERVICE`` may now be a dictionary with a ``BACKEND`` import path
  and ``OPTIONS`` that configure the service.
* Django language codes are matched to each service's language codes, and
  languages a service does not support are skipped. Use the ``language_map``
  option to add or override mappings.
* Fixed ``GoogleAPITranslatorService`` HTML escaping translations (e.g. ``'`` became
  ``&#39;``).
* **Breaking:** ``GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_KEY`` has been removed, set the ``api_key`` option
  of ``GoogleAPITranslatorService`` instead.
* **Breaking:** the ``AUTOTRANSLATE_TRANSLATOR_SERVICE`` setting has been removed, use
  ``AUTOTRANSLATE_SERVICE`` instead.
* Placeholders and HTML markup are parsed using each message's gettext flags and
  protected from translation, paid services are told not to translate them.
  More printf (``%.2f``, ``%i``, ``%%``) and brace (``{0:>10}``, ``{{``)
  placeholders are recognized, and spacing around placeholders is repaired.
  Translations that lose, change or add placeholders or markup are discarded with
  a warning, and the command raises an error if a service returns a different
  number of translations than it was sent.
* **Breaking:** ``TranslatorService.humanize_placeholders``,
  ``restore_placeholders``, ``validate_translation`` and ``fix_translation`` have
  been replaced by ``TranslatorService.protect`` and ``TranslatorService.restore``
  and the ``guard`` attribute. The command's API changed to match:
  ``get_strings_to_translate`` is now ``get_messages_to_translate``,
  ``check_translation`` is now ``restore``, ``update_translations`` takes
  ``(entries, messages, translated_strings)`` and ``MessageFile.strings`` is now
  ``MessageFile.messages``.
